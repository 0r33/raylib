about
-----

raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to learn videogames programming.

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework. 

NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to learn videogames programming; 
no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no auto-debugging... just coding in the most 
pure spartan-programmers way. Are you ready to learn? Jump to [code examples!](http://www.raylib.com/examples.html)

features
--------
 
   *  Written in plain C code (C99)
   *  Uses PascalCase/camelCase notation
   *  Hardware accelerated with OpenGL (1.1, 2.1, 3.3 or ES2)
   *  Unique OpenGL abstraction layer (usable as standalone module): [rlgl](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rlgl.c) 
   *  Powerful fonts module with multiple SpriteFonts formats support (XNA bitmap fonts, AngelCode fonts, TTF)
   *  Outstanding texture formats support, including compressed formats (DXT, ETC, PVRT, ASTC)
   *  Basic 3d support for Shapes, Models, Billboards, Heightmaps and Cubicmaps
   *  Materials (diffuse, normal, specular) and Lighting (point, directional, spot) support
   *  Shaders support, including Model shaders and Postprocessing shaders
   *  Powerful math module for Vector and Matrix operations: [raymath](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/raymath.c) 
   *  Audio loading and playing with streaming support and mixing channels (WAV, OGG, FLAC, XM, MOD)
   *  Multiple platforms support: Windows, Linux, Mac, **Android**, **Raspberry Pi** and **HTML5**
   *  VR stereo rendering support with configurable HMD device parameters
   *  Custom color palette for fancy visuals on raywhite background
   *  Minimal external dependencies (GLFW3, OpenGL, OpenAL)
   *  Complete binding to LUA: [raylib-lua](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-lua)

raylib uses on its core module the outstanding [GLFW3](http://www.glfw.org/) library. The best option I found for 
multiplatform (Windows, Linux, Mac) window/context and input management (clean, focused, great license, well documented, modern, maintained, ...).

raylib uses on its [audio](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/audio.c) module, [OpenAL Soft](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html) audio library, in multiple flavours,
to accomodate to Android, Raspberry Pi and HTML5.

On Android, raylib uses `native_app_glue module` (provided by Android NDK) and native Android libraries to manage window/context, inputs and activity life cycle.

On Raspberry Pi, raylib uses Videocore API and EGL for window/context management and raw inputs reading.

tools requirements
------------------

raylib has been developed using exclusively two tools: 

   * Notepad++ (text editor) - [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
   * MinGW (GCC compiler) - [http://www.mingw.org/](http://www.mingw.org/)
   
Those are the tools I recommend to develop with raylib, in fact, those are the tools my students use. 
I believe those are the best tools to train spartan-programmers.

Someone could argue about debugging. raylib is a library intended for learning and I think C it's a clear enough language
to allow writing small-mid size programs with a printf-based debugging. All raylib examples have also been written this way.

Since raylib v1.1, you can download a Windows Installer package for easy installation and configuration. Check [raylib Webpage](http://www.raylib.com/)
